	\item \textbf{Music} 
	\\Play in and organise rehearsals and gigs for a successful function band, initially at university, playing at larger college and university wide events, more recently at weddings in/ around London. This involved significant time management to balance with my work and studies and networking with a pool of musicians and event organisers. \\During lockdown, I coordinated virtual recording sessions and gained a basic understanding of music production to allow us to continue practising and playing.
	\item \textbf{Running}
	\\After competitively running middle and long distance in the past, now finding time for running in a more relaxed environment, allowing me to set and work towards personal goals.
